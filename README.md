# Exchange Program in China


# Priorities on arrive
* Bank account set up, before that you need a celphone card and to have enrolled in university.
* Set up meal card for the canteens (Later when you need to charge the card, use the canteen charging posts instead of the __oficial__ spots, they won't take the __exchange student__ comission).
* Find a bike, ask where you can find some during the registration day, there are plenty of 2nd or 1st hand options inside or near the campus. A bike is highly recommended given the size of the campus.
* Enter every student wechat group you can find so you'll be notified of all the parties!


# University / Life in Beijing

* Checkout what's happening in Beijing [here](https://www.thebeijinger.com/visitor-guide)
* See the movie 'The last Emperor' before going to the forbidden city.
* Go to the forbidden city before the weather is too hot (trust me).
* Wednesdays = lots of free drinks in Wudaokou (student street). Also it's Quizz night in Lust! Fun spot to hang out, mostly foreigners.

* Top outside Tibet places - Hangzhou (incredible city with both nature and tecnhology, near Shanghai, home of Alibaba/Alipay), Hong-kong/Macau, Huangshan mountain (you can camp on the top and wake up to the most amazing sunrise). (Only putting up the top places, can give a few more recomendations)
* If you go to Tokyo, Japan - [TeamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/e/?type=pickup) is an absolut must.
